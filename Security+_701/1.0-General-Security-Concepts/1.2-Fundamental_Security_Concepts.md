# 1.2 Fundamental Security Concepts


### Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA or AIC)

- Confidentiality
  - prevent disclosure of info to unauthorized people or systems
  - EX: encryption, access controls, 2FA
- Integrity
  - messages/communication cannot be modified without detection
  - EX: hashing, digital signatures, certificates
  - Non-repudiation
    - meaning it is a proof of integrity - genuine
- Availability
  - systems and network must be up running and working
  - EX: redundancy, fault-tolerance, patching

### Non-Repudiation

- EX: Signing a Contract
  - your signatures adds non-repudiation
  - you really signed the contract
  - others can verify you signed the contract

- this adds 
  1) proof of integrity, 
  2) proof of origin and authenticity

- **Proof of integrity**
  - this only verifies if data has been changed
  - verify data does not change - data is accurate and consistent
  - this is done by using a HASH
    - EX: message digest, fingerprint
  - if the data changes, the hash changes....like a fingerprint

- **Proof of Origin**
  - this only verifies if the person who sent the data to us
  - EX: authentication, private key, digital signature

### Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA)

#### Authentication
- prove who you are
- EX: passwords, 2FA, etc.
- authenticate a physical device through 
  - digitally signed certificate
  - VPN from authorized devices
  - management software like Apple MDM
 
**Certificate Authority**
- CAs manages all of an organizations certificates






#### Authorization
- authorized access based on ID, roles, etc.
- EX: group policies

#### Accounting
- log or reports of access
- EX: login time, logout time, data sent , data received, etc etc.
