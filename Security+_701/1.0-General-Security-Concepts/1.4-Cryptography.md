# 1.4 Cryptography

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- may refer to terms of policies, procedures, hardware, software responsible in creating digital certificates
- also refer to binding a public key to a device
- you might hear the word Certificate Authority

#### Public Key
- can be seen and used by anyone. 
- available to public

#### Private Key
- only one person/device as access to

#### Escrow
- someone holds or manages all your decryption keys

---

## Encryption
- protect data on storage devices (HDD, SDDs, USBs, etc.)

#### Levels

**Full disk/Partition/Volume encryption** 
- encrypt everything
- EX: BitLocker, FileVault

**File encryption** 
- encrypt a single file
- EX: EFS, third-party tools

**Database encryption** 
-
-

#### Symmetric Encryption
- means encrypting with a single shared key
  - encrypt with a key, then decrypt with the same key
- doesn't scale well
  - challenging to distribute and manage to multiple users
- very fast to use
  - less overhead than asymmetric encryption

#### Asymmetric Encryption
- means encrypting with two (or more) keys
- assign one key as public key, the other as private key
- anyone can use the public key encrypt data, BUT only the private key can decrypt that data
- you can't reverse engineer or obtain another private key from a public key

#### Key Value Pair
- generated from Asymmetric Encryption
- this is where both the public and private keys are generated simultaneously
