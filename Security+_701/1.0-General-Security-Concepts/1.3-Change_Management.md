# 1.3 Change Management

- change can be software updates, patches, configurations, etc.
- changes poses risks
- changes require clear polices, process, and procedures

## Business Processes

#### Approval Process
- a formal process for managing change
- avoids downtime, confusion and mistakes
- a typical process would be:
  - complete request forms
  - determine the purpose of the change
  - schedule date and time of change
  - determine affected systems and impact
  - analyze associated risk
  - get approval from change control board
  - once change is made, get end-user feedback

#### Ownership
- an individual or entity
- they own the process
- they don't usually perform the actual change, but MANAGE the process
- they manage by:
  - providing updates of the change
  - ensures the process is followed, acceptable and tested
- EX:
  - Change: label printers need to be upgraded
  - Ownership: Shipping and Receiving department owns the process
  - Process: IT handles the actual change

#### Stakeholders
- individuals or departments impacted by change
- IT team will need to research all users who will be impacted
- EX: upgrading label printers will affect multiple users and departments

#### Impact Analysis 
- determine risk value (high, med, low)
- Risks by making change:
  - the fix doesn't fix anything
  - the fix breaks something else
  - OS failures, data corruption, etc.
- Risk by NOT making change:
  - security and application vulnerability
  - unexpected downtime

#### Test Results
- use a sandbox test environment to test a patch/upgrade/change
- test and confirm before production deployment
- confirm a backout plan
  - document a series of steps before change was made

#### Backout Plan
- You should always have a way to revert your changes
- EX: this can be a simple process such as uninstalling the patch
- always have backups prior to update

#### Maintenance Window
- time to implement change
- overnight changes are best to avoid downtime during work hours
- avoid changes during busy holidays

#### Standard Operating Procedure
- change management is critical affecting everyone in the org
- this process must be well documented

## Technical Implications

- putting the change management process into action from a IT team perspective

#### Allow Lists / Deny Lists
- IT will allow or deny certain applications
- Allow list:
  - only these software on this list will be executed 
- Deny list:
  - no software on this list will be executed 
  - EX: anti-virus, anti-malware

#### Restricted Activities
- the scope of a change is important
  - meaning only make changes specifically listed in the change control document
- having a change approved isn't permission to make any change.
- change approval is very specific
- EX: approved change is update printers...so do not update other devices only printers
- if other devices/software need to be changed, then the scope will need to be expanded during this change window

#### Downtime
- services will eventually be unavailable
- change processes can be disruptive
- usually scheduled during non-production hours
- if possible, prevent any downtime
  - have secondary systems
- send emails and calendar updates to all users

#### Restarts
- restarts are common to implement a new configuration or change

**Service Restart**
- stop and restart service in Windows Services, Task Manager, etc.
- takes seconds to minutes

**Application Restart**
- restart application then launch it again

#### Legacy Applications
- changes can affect old applications by being no longer supported
- if unsupported, then you are now the support team

#### Dependencies
- a change that will require you to make another change first
- EX: an app that requires you to download a specific library version
- this complicates the process from updating 1 to now many.

## Documentation
- it is difficult to keep up with changes
- documentation can be outdated quickly
- which is the reason why documentation is required in the change management process

#### Updating Diagrams
- modifications to network configurations
- address updates

#### Updating Polices and Procedures
- adding new systems or apps may require mew procedures

---

## Version Control
- tracks changes to a file or configuration over time
- easily revert to a previous setting
- EX: Git/GitHub
