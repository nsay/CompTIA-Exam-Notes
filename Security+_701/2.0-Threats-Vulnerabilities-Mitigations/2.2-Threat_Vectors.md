# 2.2 Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces

## Threat Vectors
- A method used by the attacker
- Gain access or infect to the target 
- Also called "attack vectors"

---

## Message-Based
- Phishing attacks
  - People want to click links
  - Links in an email, links send via text or IM
- Deliver the malware to the user
  - Attach it to the email
  - Scan all attachments, never launch untrusted links
- Social engineering attacks
  - Invoice scams, cryptocurrency scams

#### Email
- message links in an email
- link to malicious site

#### Short Message Service (SMS) and Instant Messaging (IM)
- attacks in a text message

---

## Image Based
- more difficult to identify the threat in an image
- Some image formats can be a threat:
  - The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) format
    - Image is described in XML (Extensible Markup Language)
- Meaning images can pose significant security concerns:
  - HTML injection
  - Javascript attack code
- Browsers must provide input validation 
  - Avoids running malicious code

---

## File Based
- More than just executables
  - Malicious code can hide in many places
- EX:
  - Adobe PDF
    - A file format containing other objects
  - ZIP/RAR files (or any compression type) 
    - Contains many different files
  - Microsoft Office
    - Documents with macros 
    - Add-in files

---

## Voice Call
- Vishing
  - Phishing over the phone
- Spam over IP
  - Large-scale phone calls
- War dialing
  - using unpublished numbers to get access to systems
- Call tampering
  - Disrupting voice calls

---

## Removable Device
- attackers can use a USB drive to get around a firewall
- Malicious software on USB flash drives
  - Infect air gapped networks
  - Industrial systems, high-security services
- USB devices can act as keyboards 
  - Hacker on a chip
- Data exfiltration
  - Terabytes of data walk out the door 
  - Zero bandwidth used

---

## Vulnerable Software

#### Client-based
- Infected executable
- Known (or unknown) vulnerabilities 
- May require constant updates

#### Agentless
- No installed executable
- Compromised software on the server would affect all users
- Client runs a new instance each time

---

## Unsupported Systems and Applications
- Patching is an important prevention tool 
  - Ongoing security fixes
- Unsupported systems aren’t patched 
  - There may not even be an option
- Outdated operating systems
  - Eventually, even the manufacturer won’t help
- Keep your inventory and records current

---

## Unsecure Networks

#### Wireless
- these are Outdated security protocols (WEP, WPA, WPA2) 
- Open or rogue wireless networks

#### Wired
- Unsecure interfaces 
- No 802.1X

#### Bluetooth
- Reconnaissance, implementation vulnerabilities

---

## Open Service Ports
- most common network ports are TCP or UDP port
- Every open port is an opportunity for the attacker
- Every application has their own open port

---

## Default Credentials
- Most devices have default usernames and passwords
  - Most are Admin accounts 
  - Administrator access

---

## Supply Chain
- these threat vectors access your infrastructure by riding inside your existing equipment
- the threat was either before or after manufacturing process

#### Manage Service Providers (MSPs)
-  Access many different customer networks from one
location
- if attack gains access to MSP, then they will have access to you

#### Vendors
-  Access many different customer networks from one
location
- EX: attackers gains access to Target's contractors which enables them to gain access to Target's network

#### Suppliers
- Counterfeit networking equipment
- Install backdoors, substandard performance and availability

---

## Human vectors/social engineering

#### Phishing
- Social engineering with a touch of spoofing
  - Often delivered by email, text, etc.
  - fake email, text, URLs, images, etc.

#### Vishing
- Voice phishing
- over the phone or voicemail

#### Smishing (SMS)
- by text messages

#### Misinformation/Disinformation
- Disseminate factually incorrect information 
- Create confusion and division
- Influence campaigns
  - Sway public opinion on political and social issues
- social media

#### Impersonation
- Attackers pretend to be someone they aren’t
- Use some of details you know to fool you

#### Business Email Compromise
- Spoofed email addresses
- We trust reputable email sources/addresses 
  - Attackers take advantage of this trust

#### Pretexting
- Lying to get information
- Attacker is a character in a situation they create
- EX: *Hi, we’re calling from Visa regarding an automated payment
to your utility service...*

#### Watering Hole
- What if users are highly secure and intelligent in security?
- This is where we want the victims to come to us.
- Attackers do some research on your most commonly visit website, then they inflict those websites to get to you.
- Prevention Methods:
  - Firewalls, IPS
  - Anti-virus / Anti-malware signature updates

#### Brand Impersonation
- Pretend to be a well-known brand
- create thousands of ads on various websites
- Visitors are presented with a pop-up
- Malware infection is almost guaranteed

#### Typosquatting
- A type of URL typos/misdirection/hijacking
- EX: www.gooogle.com is a URL typo which is common. Attackers exploit this.
