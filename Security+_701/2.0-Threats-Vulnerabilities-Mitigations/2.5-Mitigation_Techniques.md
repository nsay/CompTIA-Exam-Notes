# 2.5 Mitigation Techniques

## Segmentation
- practice of dividing a network into distinct segments or subnets to:
  - enhance security and performance
  - allowing for better control over traffic flow, - containment of security breaches
  - enforcement of policies tailored to specific segments.
- Physical, logical, or virtual segmentation 
  - Devices, VLANs, virtual networks
- Performance
  - High-bandwidth applications
- Security
  - Users should not talk directly to database servers 
  - The only applications in the core are SQL and SSH
- Compliance
  - Mandated segmentation (PCI compliance) 
  - Makes change control much easier

## Access Control

#### Access Control List (ACL)
- Allow or disallow traffic
  - Source IP, Destination IP, port number, time of day, application, etc.
- Restrict access to network devices
  - Limit by IP address or other identifier
  - Prevent regular user / non-admin access

#### Permissions
- A set of rules that determines who can access specific resources and what actions they can perform.
