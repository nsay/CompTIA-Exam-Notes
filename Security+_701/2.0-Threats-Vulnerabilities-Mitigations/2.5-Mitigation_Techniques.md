# 2.5 Mitigation Techniques

## Segmentation
- practice of dividing a network into distinct segments or subnets to:
  - enhance security and performance
  - allowing for better control over traffic flow, - containment of security breaches
  - enforcement of policies tailored to specific segments.
- Physical, logical, or virtual segmentation 
  - Devices, VLANs, virtual networks
- Performance
  - High-bandwidth applications
- Security
  - Users should not talk directly to database servers 
  - The only applications in the core are SQL and SSH
- Compliance
  - Mandated segmentation (PCI compliance) 
  - Makes change control much easier

---

## Access Control

#### Access Control List (ACL)
- Allow or disallow traffic
  - Source IP, Destination IP, port number, time of day, application, etc.
- Restrict access to network devices
  - Limit by IP address or other identifier
  - Prevent regular user / non-admin access

#### Permissions
- A set of rules that determines who can access specific resources and what actions they can perform.

---

##  Application Allow List 
- specifies which applications are permitted to run on a system, blocking all others by default.
- can be specified to only allow applications that has a unique ID, certificates, folder path or network zones.

---

## Isolation
- Separating compromised or sensitive systems from the rest of the network to contain threats or prevent unauthorized access.
- Limits the spread of malware or attacks and protects critical systems.
- Methods:
  - Network Segmentation: 
    - Isolating parts of the network (e.g., DMZ).
  - Virtualization: 
    - Running applications in isolated virtual environments.
  - Sandboxing: 
    - Executing untrusted code in a controlled, isolated environment.

---

## Patching
- most important task for any device
- monthly updates, third-party updates, auto-updates, zero-day updates

---

## Encryption
- prevent access to data files 
- File level encryption
  - Windows EFS
- Full disk encryption (FDE)
  - Encrypt everything on the drive
  - BitLocker, FileVault, etc.

---

## Monitoring
- Aggregate information from devices
  - Built-in sensors, separate devices
  - Integrated into servers, switches, routers, firewalls, etc.
- Sensors
  - Intrusion prevention systems, firewall logs, authentication logs, web server access logs, database transaction logs, email logs
- Collectors
  - Proprietary consoles (IPS, firewall),
  - SIEM consoles, syslog servers

---

## Least Privilege
- Rights and permissions should be set to the bare
minimum
  - You only get exactly what’s needed to complete your task
- Don’t allow users to run with administrative privileges

---

## Configuration Enforcement
- Extensive check of system
  - OS patch version
  - EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) version
  - Status of firewall and EDR
  - Certificate status
- Systems out of compliance are quarantined
  - Private VLAN with limited access
  - Recheck after making corrections

---

## Decommissioning
- Don’t throw your storage devices into the trash
- Devices such as:
  - Hard drive
  - SSD
  - USB drives
- You want to either:
  1. Recycle the device for use in another system or,
  2. Destroy the device

---

## Hardening Techniques
- securing a system by reducing its attack surface.
- such as updates/patches, user accounts requirements, limit network access, anti-virus, and anti-malware 

#### Encryption
- Prevent access to application data files
  - File system encryption
  - Windows Encrypting File System (EFS)
- Full disk encryption (FDE)
  - Encrypt everything on the drive
  - Windows BitLocker, Apple FileVault, etc.
- Encrypt all network communication
  - Virtual Private Networking (VPN)
  - Application encryption

#### Installation of Endpoint Protection
- Deploying security software on individual devices (endpoints) like computers, phones, or servers.
- Antivirus or Antimalware
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
  1. detect threat
    - this may be from agent
  2. investigate threat
    - root cause analysis
  3. respond to threat
    - isolate system, quarantine the threat

#### Host-based Firewall
- Software-based firewall
  - Personal firewall, runs on every endpoint
- Allow or disallow incoming or outgoing application network traffic
  - Controlled by application

#### Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)
- A security system installed on individual hosts or devices that monitors and prevents malicious activities.

#### Disabling Ports/Protocols
- Every open port is a possible entry point
  - Close everything except required ports
- Control port access with a firewall

#### Default Password Changes
- Every device has a default username and password, as well as a management interface using default credentials
- CHANGE THIS

#### Removal of Unnecessary Software
- all software will have some kind of bugs and vulnerabilities
- remove any software you do not use
